# Automated CLI Deployment - I'll Do It For You!

I'm going to set everything up via Railway CLI so you don't have to click through the dashboard.

## What I'll Do:

1. ✅ Login to Railway (will open browser once)
2. ✅ Link to your existing project
3. ✅ Set all environment variables automatically
4. ✅ Configure the service
5. ✅ Deploy it

## What You Need to Do:

Just one thing - when Railway CLI opens your browser:
- Click "Authorize" or "Allow" to connect Railway CLI
- That's it!

Then I'll handle everything else automatically.

---

## After Deployment:

I'll give you:
- Your Railway URL
- Instructions to update Vercel
- Test the connection

Let's do this! 🚀
