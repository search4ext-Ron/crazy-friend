# Finding "New Project" in Railway

The button might be in different places depending on your Railway dashboard view.

## Where to Look:

### Option 1: Top Right Corner
- Look for a **"+"** button (plus icon)
- Or **"New"** button
- Or **"Create"** button
- Usually in the top navigation bar

### Option 2: Dashboard Home
- If you're on the Railway home/dashboard
- Look for a large **"New Project"** card or button
- Might say **"Create Project"** or **"Start New Project"**

### Option 3: Left Sidebar
- Check the left sidebar menu
- Look for **"Projects"** → then a **"+"** or **"New"** button

### Option 4: Empty State
- If you have no projects yet, there might be a big **"Create Your First Project"** button in the center

### Option 5: Projects Page
- Click on **"Projects"** in the left menu (if visible)
- Then look for **"New Project"** or **"+"** button

## What Does Your Railway Dashboard Look Like?

Can you describe what you see?
- Are you on the main dashboard/home page?
- Do you see any projects listed?
- What buttons/icons are visible in the top navigation?
- Is there a left sidebar menu?

## Alternative: Use Railway CLI

If you can't find the button, we can use the CLI instead:

```bash
cd "/Users/ronaldmoore/Cursor/Crazy Friend/server"
railway login
railway init
```

This will create a project via command line!
